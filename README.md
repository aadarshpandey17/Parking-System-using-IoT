# Smart-Parking-System-using-IoT
Smart Parking System is an IoT-based solution that uses ESP8266 and IR sensors to monitor parking slot availability in real time. Sensor data is sent to Firebase, which handles the database, authentication, and hosting. A secure web dashboard shows live slot status, reviews, and contact features, helping users find parking quickly and efficiently.
